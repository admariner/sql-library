title: Last 7 Days VS Previous 7 Days
description: This query compares the sessions of the last 7 days to the previous 7 days aggregated by `campaign_name`. This query demonstrates the use of a concept that can be used with any dimension and metric\\s, comparing different values of the metric based on different values of time or a given dimension.
requirements: Collect data with the Panoply Facebook Ads data source.
usage: This query can be used to create a bar chart comparing the `last_7` and `previous_7` for each campaign or simply displayed as a table.
modifications: The table in the `FROM` might need to be changed based on Schema and Destination settings in the data source. Other dimensions and metrics can be added as filters to the `WHERE` or by adding a `HAVING` clause and other aggregations can be added on top of `last_7` and `previous_7`. This query sums the metric `clicks`, this can be changed to a different metric like `spend` or `impressions`.
