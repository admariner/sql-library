title: Monthly Performance Breakdown
description: This query sums the total cost, clicks and impressions by month and year from `facebook-ads`.
requirements: Collect data with the Panoply Facebook Ads data source.
usage: This query can be used to create a line or bar chart of cost \ impressions \ clicks over time.
modifications: The table in the `FROM` might need to be changed based on Schema and Destination settings in the data source. The columns `campaign_name` or your chosen breakdown (`country` by default) can be added to the `WHERE` as filters or to the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` for an additional level of aggregation granularity.
