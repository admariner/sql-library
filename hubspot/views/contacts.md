title: Contacts Report
description: Denormalized view of Hubspot's default values in `hubspot_contacts_properties` key-value pair table
usage: This is the "ready for analysis" view of Hubspot contacts
modifications: Properties can be removed or added. To add custom properties, refer to your Hubspot properties setting for their name. Dates are formatted as Unix timestamps so they must be transformed and cast into dates.
