title: Customer Order Annual Overview
description: This query shows an overview of a customer's orders by processing method, financial status, discount codes, and total discount derived from Shopify data.
requirements: Collect the `Orders` Resource with the Panoply Shopify data source. This will create sub-tables for the `Customer` and `Discount Codes` data.
usage: This query can be displayed in a tabular form to display the order pattern of the customer.
modifications: The table in the `FROM` might need to be changed based on Schema and Destination settings in the data source. The Date Range Filter using the `created_at` in the `WHERE` clause can be changed.
